                                        The villa is a part of La Cucina Sabina. It is best described as a luxurious country home which sits on a 150-acre estate surrounded by olive and cherry orchards. Located in the tranquil Sabine hills, at the foothills of the Lucretelli Mountain range, La Cucina Sabina is near enough to Rome to enjoy rich culture, yet far enough to be an oasis of peacefulness and beauty. An inspiring work of architecture, the three-story villa combines the clean lines of Frank Lloyd Wright with classic Italian architecture, bringing in amazing vistas through the floor to ceiling glass, of the beautiful surrounding mountains, gardens, and pool.

                                        The villa underwent a major renovation and refurbishment in 2015. It boasts a state of the art demonstration kitchen, impressive art collection, baby grand piano, salt water pool, sauna, rose garden, outdoor pizza oven, eight bedrooms (all with en-suite bathrooms), nine bathrooms, tennis court, and nighttime vistas of lighted hilltop castles. This resort provides a guest washer/dryer, free high speed WiFi and hairdryers in each room.

                                        Each bedroom has custom made American king-sized beds that also can divide into twins, large closets, TVs, free Wi-Fi, and premium olive oil based toiletries. Two upstairs suites include balconies with sweeping vistas, large soaking tubs, and separate showers. All upstairs rooms provide views of mountains, hills, and countryside. Ground floor rooms have direct garden access and a shared patio. The villa is near a local train that runs directly into Rome throughout the day.

                                        Cooking focuses on authentic plus contemporary Italian cuisine, taught by the professional chef who trained in a Michelin three-star restaurant, as well as a local Nonna for pizza. La Cucina Sabina teaches regional recipes using only the freshest, seasonal and authentic farm-to-table ingredients including antipasti (appetizers), fresh pasta, sauces, risotto, vegetarian dishes, meats and seafood dishes, cooking pizza on our outdoor oven, dolci (desserts), and gelato, etc. Not keen on too much cooking? Don't worry, the lessons are only part of what La Cucina Sabina offers and are completely optional with plenty of ways to relax and enjoy your time. Transfers are provided to and from Rome's airport and the main train stations to the villa in Sabina, minutes from Rome. Check-in is on Sunday afternoon with check-out on the following Saturday morning.

                                            On your arrival, La Cucina Sabina provides transfers and pick you up at Rome's main airport, train station, or city hotel. Once you arrive at the villa, you check in, get comfortable and relax in the spacious villa or well-maintained gardens and grounds. A light buffet lunch and Prosecco are served with the afternoon left open to relax and enjoy your fellow guests or enjoy a refreshing swim or sauna. In the evening, the delicious four-course welcome dinner with professional waiter service is served on the sunset terrace (weather permitting) overlooking the olive groves and beautiful hills and mountains. You will discuss the exciting week ahead.

                                            You begin each morning with a full buffet breakfast in the formal dining room or under one of the covered outdoor terraces overlooking the pool, olive trees hillsides, and mountains. The first cooking lesson begins in the mid-morning with the professional chef. Because La Cucina Sabina is hands-on, you will be preparing your lunch that you will enjoy. In the late afternoon, you head to Castello Savelli, a medieval castle in the hilltop town of Palombara Sabina, a short drive from the villa.

                                            You will enjoy a private tour of the castle and museum with ancient statues and then a sunset prosecco reception overlooking the Sabine Hills and valley. This is a rare opportunity to visit the castle and museum which is not normally open to the public and experience the same stunning views of Sabina that Margaret Thatcher and her husband saw on their many visits to their "secret getaway". A four-course private dinner is a few steps down the cobblestone path to the old Tavern Ristorante.

                                            After a buffet breakfast, you visit the ancient hilltop town of Tivoli for a guided tour of the beautiful gardens of Villa d'Este, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, where you will be amazed at the Renaissance villa, gardens, and fountains. The Renaissance gardens stood as a model for others throughout Europe to follow. Along the way, you will visit the morning farmers market as the locals do. After lunch at a historic restaurant in Tivoli, overlooking an ancient Roman temple, you return to La Cucina Sabina for your afternoon lesson with the professional chef, followed by dinner on the sunset terrace overlooking the olive groves and Monte Serrate.

                                            Following your buffet breakfast, you depart for "Discover the Secrets of Ancient Rome" tour. In a special, guided tour of the city, you visit places not normally seen by tourists, making your visit very special and unique. Experience the Rome that the locals know, with a rare combination of art, food, culture, and history in a very full day experiencing "la dolce vita". Both lunch and dinner will be enjoyed in Rome. During the afternoon, the tour continues or optional free time is available for shopping or independent touring. A four-course dinner is enjoyed on a private rooftop apartment hosted by local Italians and overlooking the beautiful skyline with its magical sunset.

To complement the winery, you stroll through the wonderful hilltop Umbrian town of Orvieto, with its dramatic vistas, medieval walls, Etruscan ruins, shops and cathedral. This town dates back all the way back to ancient Etruscan times. In the evening, you have your pizza lesson and dinner at the villa where you will learn how to make pizza using the authentic outdoor wood burning oven.

                                            Begin the day by enjoying a delicious homemade breakfast. Since the estate produces its own DOP extra virgin olive oil, you will visit the olive grove and local mill. As part of the visit, you learn what the Romans knew about growing olives 2000 years ago as well as the modern Italian methods of producing some of the best olive oil in the world. You return to the villa and enjoy a tasting of olive oils and lesson on understanding what makes an olive oil great. After some R & R, you begin your fourth lesson with your chef. You use all your skills learned during the week for your big grand finale five-course dinner, cooking everything from antipasto to dolce!
